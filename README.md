Replication of Stephen Ryan's ECMA 2012 article for the Empirical Methods in
Applied Micro Class.

## Code

Scripts for replication can be found in the code folder. The folder also includes
a README file for explanations. I chose to write do the replication using Julia
instead of Stephen's choice of Java. One reason for that is the requirements of
the class (I could not copy and paste the original code), another reason is by
choice since I believe Julia to be a better fit to this type of problems.

## Data and original code

The data and original scripts are available through the article's website. For
the code in this repo to work, one needs to download them and add them to a folder
named "data", without changing the names of the files.
